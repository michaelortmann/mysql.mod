########## Tcl Commands ##########

mysql_connect <database> <hostname> [user] [password] [socket|port]
Initializes the connection to the database.  If hostname is `localhost', the
connection will be piped into a socket instead of using a tcp port.  Socket is
the path to the unix socket, such as /tmp/mysql.sock.

mysql_close
Closed the current database connection, freeing its memory.

mysql_query <query>
Executes a query and returns its results in a nested list.  A semi-colon is
automatically appended to the end of the statement.

mysql_escape [byte] <string>
Makes a string safe to be used in MySQL.  Adds backslashes before single
quotes, doubles backslashes, and so on.  Only specify the byte argument if you
are handling binary data.  Using it incorrectly will crash your bot, or worse.

mysql_errno
Returns the error code that was last encountered. A list of error codes is
available at: http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Error-returns.html

mysql_ping
Checks whether the connection to the server is working. If it has gone down, an
automatic reconnection is attempted.

mysql_connectioninfo
If connected, returns a list of database name, hostname, user, and port/sock.

mysql_insert_id
Returns the ID from the last insertion.

mysql_connected
Return whether the module thinks the database is linked (true) or not (false).
Note: It can be wrong.

mysql_affected_rows
Returns the number of rows that were changed by the last query.
